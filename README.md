# Planet Core 

Hello there!

PlanetCore is a mod that work with Cubic Chunks. It allow you to dig all the way to the Earth's core!

You first dig to the crust, then the mantle and eventually you end up inside the core. 

The deeper you dig, the more dangerous it get while you also find more precious gems.

I got inspired by many games such as Motherload and terraria.
